# StakeHub

A decentralized application that enables users to stake ERC20 tokens and earn rewards in return.

## Key Tokens

- **Stake Token** : GOLD, ERC20 token used for staking within the DApp.
- **Reward Token** : FIAT, Another ERC20 token generated as reward for staking.

## Functionality

1. **Stake Tokens:**
* Users approve a certain amount of stake tokens to be staked within the DApp by interacting with the staking smart contract.

2. **Generate Reward:**
* Once the stake tokens are staked, the smart contract generates reward tokens per second based on the staked amount.

3. **Accumulate Rewards:**
* Users accumulate reward tokens over time as they keep their stake tokens staked within the DApp.

4. **Claim Rewards:**
* Users can claim their accumulated rewards by interacting with the smart contract using the getReward() function.

5. **Unstake Tokens:**
* After a staking period or at any point, users can unstake their tokens using the appropriate function in the DApp to retrieve their staked tokens along with the accumulated rewards.
